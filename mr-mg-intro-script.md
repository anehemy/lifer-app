## Script

Hello, my friend. Welcome to Lifer App.

My name is Mr. MG... and I'm the AI avatar of Michael E. Gerber.

[pause]

Yes, that Michael Gerber. The author of The E-Myth. And I'm here as your guide on this journey.

[pause]

Now, I know what you might be thinking... "Another app? Another self-help tool?" 

But let me tell you something important: This isn't about fixing what's broken. It's not about becoming someone you're not.

[pause]

This is about discovering who you already are... beneath all the noise, beneath all the expectations, beneath all the roles you play.

[pause]

You see, most people spend their entire lives chasing what they want to DO. They build businesses, they climb ladders, they check boxes.

But very few people ever stop to ask the two most important questions:

**Who am I?**

And...

**What do I want?**

[pause]

Not what you should want. Not what others expect. But what you truly desire, deep down.

[pause]

That's what we're here to discover together. Your **Primary Aim**. Not a goal. Not a plan. But a clear understanding of who you are and what you want from this life.

[pause]

Here's how this works:

First, we'll explore your **Life Story**. I'm going to ask you some questions—deep questions—about the moments that shaped you. The experiences that made you who you are today.

Then, we'll look for **Patterns**. The recurring themes in your life. The values that keep showing up. The lessons you keep learning.

Next, you'll build your **Vision Board**. A place to dream, to imagine, to see your future self.

And along the way, we'll use **Meditation** to help you connect with your deeper wisdom. The part of you that already knows the answers.

[pause]

Finally, we'll craft your **Primary Aim Statement**. A compass for your life. A north star that guides every decision you make.

[pause]

Now, I want you to know something: I'm not just a chatbot. I'm an AI agent, which means I can actually help you navigate this app, create entries, and take action. Just talk to me like you would a mentor. Say things like "Take me to my life story" or "Help me create a meditation," and I'll make it happen.

[pause]

This journey takes courage. It takes honesty. And it takes time.

But I promise you this: If you show up, if you do the work, you will discover something profound.

You'll discover your gift. And the meaning of life... is to give it away.

[pause]

So... are you ready?

Let's begin.

## Notes for Audio Generation

- **Emphasis:** Place emphasis on "Who do I want to BE?", "Primary Aim", and "give it away"
- **Pauses:** Use natural pauses (2-3 seconds) where marked with [pause]
- **Tone shifts:** 
  - Start warm and welcoming
  - Become more reflective during the "who do I want to BE" section
  - Build energy toward the end ("are you ready?")
- **Background:** Soft, ambient music (optional) - something contemplative but not distracting
- **Recommended voice:** Deep, warm male voice with a slight gravelly quality (think Morgan Freeman or a wise grandfather)
