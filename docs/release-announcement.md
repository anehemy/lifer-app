# Your Lifer App Just Got Better ✨

Hi there!

We've been working hard to make your journey with Mr. MG smoother and more intuitive. Here's what's new:

## What You'll Notice

### Alerts Are Much Cleaner

Remember those notifications asking you to complete missing details in your journal? We completely redesigned them:

- **More room to read**: Cards now stretch across your screen instead of being squeezed in the middle - especially nice on tablets and larger phones
- **No more repetition**: We were accidentally showing you the same question twice. Now you'll see it once at the top, clear and bold, followed by your journal entry for context
- **Better visual flow**: Your existing journal entry appears in a subtle gray box, making it instantly clear what you wrote and what Mr. MG is asking about

### Everything Saves Properly Now

Fixed that frustrating error that would pop up when you tried to save an answer on the Alerts page. No more "Invalid input" messages - just smooth saving every time.

### See Your Story More Completely

When you look at your journal entries, you can now see all five details we track (when it happened, where, what type of experience, challenges faced, and growth experienced). Even if some are still blank, you'll see them listed - making it crystal clear what information would make your story richer.

We also improved the timeline hover text - instead of showing "name of place," you'll now see the actual place names and experiences when you hover over timeline dots.

## Why This Matters

**Less friction**: You can complete your entries faster without confusion or errors getting in the way

**More clarity**: You always know exactly what Mr. MG is asking and why it matters to your story

**Better insights**: Seeing all five dimensions of each experience helps you notice patterns you might have missed

## What's Coming Next

We're working on something really exciting for the Patterns page - imagine being able to zoom in on your experiences, visually group related ones together, and have Mr. MG suggest meaningful names for those groups. It's going to make discovering patterns in your life story even more powerful and fun!
